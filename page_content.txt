What do we do?
Flagstone is a professional construction company completing projects throughout the south east of England. We operate with a combination of our own skilled staff and teams of vetted and approved contractors to ensure projects are completed to a high standard, within budget and within agreed timescales.
Design & Build
For customers who require complete project management we operate a design and build service in which we manage everything from an initial consultation through to project completion. Through working relationships with architects, structural engineers and quality surveyors we are able to take a project from conception to completion in the most efficient way possible.
Electrical Contracting
Flagstone has an in house electrical contracting capacity which covers a range of requirements, from emergency call outs through minor works to complete electrical installations.
Refurbishment & General Works
We undertake new build and refurbishment projects in both residential and commercial environments as well as providing emergency callout cover and minor works maintenance repairs. From our workshop in Essex we are able to produce specialist pieces of joinery at short notice to avoid delays, particularly during refurbishments where problems are uncovered as a project proceeds.
